                <h3>Vission</h3>
                <p>Most of life is filled with uncertainty. This is especially true of the future. But if you can hold onto a vision of whatâ€™s yet to come, you can boost your chances at achieving your dreams and being successful. What is vision exactly? How does it help, and what does it mean to have a vision?</p>

                <h3>Goals</h3>
                <p>According to Locke and Latham, goals affect performance in the following ways:[3]

                    goals direct attention and effort toward goal-relevant activities,
                    difficult goals lead to greater effort,
                    goals increase persistence, with difficult goals prolonging effort, and
                    goals indirectly lead to arousal, and to discovery and use of task-relevant knowledge and strategies</p>
